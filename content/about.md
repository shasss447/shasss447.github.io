This all started when I was in 9th class and was introduced to a programming language "Java".
I began enjoying coding and started wondering about the infinite secrets lying behind
my screen. However, it wasn't until I entered college that I truly embarked
on a mission to clear the dark clouds in my mind.

Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. Despite being occupied with academic responsibilities, I couldn't divert my mind
from that void of unknowingness. i work, research, inquire and try every other way
to learn but what results is a more dense and tangled web. Each time I believe I am close to uncovering a fragment of the screen's mystery, it proves to be an illusion.

For over a year and a half, I've been performing sheriff for my own case, i diving
more and more deep, with no idea of bed, to reach the bed. Today also I wonder about the
infinite secrets and my mind orders to quest them all. I am scrubbing every corner of this
"landscape of digital disruption", if not till the core, crust atleast, to find my realm
and finally plunge into it. I desire to reach the trench, if not the whole, then let there
be a sole representation.

On this website, anyone will discover insightful stories and personal experiences from a variety of tech projects, works, and everyday adventures, all of which happens to me.
